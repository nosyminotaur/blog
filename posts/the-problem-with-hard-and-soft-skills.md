excerpt: "There are many skills to develop and master in a tech career. The problem is suggesting some skills are 'harder' or 'softer' than others."

Imagine you are giving awards for individuals that best demonstrate hard and soft technical skills.

- Who would get the hard skill award?

- Who would get the soft skill award?

- Why aren't they same person?

- Why aren't the genders the same?
<br />

If this makes you uncomfortable, it's one of the many problems with using 'hard' and 'soft' to describe skills. I don't have time to go through all the societal reasons why we associate things that are difficult or hard as 'masculine' or 'manly', but it immediately moves us to why I should value these skills more than others-similar to the trope 'Boys don't wear pink'.

<br />

Some other problems:

-   Hard implies difficulty in learning or mastering, and therefore, more valuable. Conversely soft is seen as easier to learn, and consequently less valuable (Not true)
    
-   Hard implies easiert to see, interact with and measure which correleates with more impact. Soft is 'fuzzy', harder to read and understand. (Again, false)
    
-   Categories ultimately create barriers-you can't been be a good people person AND a good developer (Again, false)
    
-   Implies a superiority, that one set of skills is better/worse than the other (...you see where I'm going)

<br />
    

If we want people to develop and be their best selves, it's important to recognize it's a both-and, not either-or. I want someone that can master languages, _and_ has the patience to mentor others. Why not have a great communicator within DevOps? A highly empathatic C# developer? Not only do they exist, but when they do, and are allowed to thrive they make all our lives better.

## Great-but what do I say now?
<br />

Well, what I'm going with at the moment is qualitative/quantitative. Sometimes I want more food, but I definitely don't want it rotten. I'm happier with fewer dates if they're better ones. There's no hierarchy between qualitative and quantitative-both are equally valuable, and I can shift priorities depending on the context. It also removes the border between the skills, and allows me to optimize my development, rather than being forced down a path.

So next time in your appraisal or 1-to-1, try using qualitative/quantitative (or whatever you come up with), and save hard/soft for types of cheese. What opportunities open for you that didn't before?
