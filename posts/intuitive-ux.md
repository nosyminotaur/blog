When we're looking at interface, one that is "intuitive" is one that everyone wants to make. But what is an "intuitive" interface?

Defining an intuitive interface is easy.
> An intuitive interface is one that works the way the user expects it to.

To be put in simpler words, it's intuitive if you don't have to think about it.
In a lot of cases, they are easy to look into and judge whether they fit the definition, but here's some cases where the differences are minute enough -

So, why is Prototype 2 "intuitive" and the 1st one not? Because Prototype 1 puts the focus on the wrong object. Your action is the same, but the time taken for the user to put his focus on where he has to input his phone number is a lot more in Prototype 1. This is just a small difference that puts Prototype 2 at an advantage.

I'm in no way saying that Prototype 1 is bad, I'm just saying it could it be a little bit more intuitive, that's all.
